Hi, I’m Diego — a full stack developer passionate about building fintech and data-driven web applications that people actually use.
I love working across the stack — from designing intuitive interfaces in React to architecting scalable APIs in NestJS and PostgreSQL.
My focus is on building complete, production-ready products that connect finance, data, and technology.
